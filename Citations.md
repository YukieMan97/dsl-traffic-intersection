**Credit**

I (Avi) used code written by someone else as a base for the simulation core loop. Unfortunately I did not not note down the source at the time of using that code, and I cannot find it anymore as I ended up modifying it. I also used directly used code from the stack overflow article directly to rotate images for the simulation. No changes were made to this code piece.
